Week 1
Class 2
Chem 210 Computer Lab

## Workspace
- Using Windows Notepad, spend time working on the Personal Introduction exercise

## Demo (646): PHP introduction
The demo can be viewed at http://www.codeyourheartout.com/examples/randomDieRoll/ and the code can be downloaded at https://github.com/PresentLocation/randomDieRoll
- PHP is its own scripting language separate from HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- PHP is server-side scripting, which means PHP is processed before the document leaves the server and arrives at the browser.
- PHP is used to process data, run logic, and generate dynamic content that is to be used in some way in the document.
- PHP handles math and strings
- PHP uses variables to provide an abstract approach to processing information.
- In a document, PHP is placed above the HTML
- PHP is cool!
- PHP concepts demonstrated: variable, string, math, output, function, randomization
- PHP methods demonstrated: print, rand(), switch()
- Use PHP Fiddle to work on scripting exercises: https://codepen.io/codeyourheartout/pen/QWbyqaZ

## Lecture
### Today's theme: Container
- As a design metaphor, the container is a form we can learn to recognize as a dominant solution in design
- Containers gather energy and resources
- Containers provide an opportunity to manage time and space
- Containers offer the chance to present a sense of order, a sense of beauty
- When containers, or containment, is absent, so to do the above qualities begin to become inaccessible
- Container motif can be understood on all levels - conceptually, aesthetically, and technically
- This course organizes learning using the container motif
- Classroom is our physical container to learn together
- Website is our online space to advance through the course together
- GitHub is our online container for source code
- CodePen is our online container for exercise work
- HTML5 is our primary method for actualizing designs of the web experience

## Demo: Coding containers
The demo can be viewed at https://codepen.io/codeyourheartout/pen/gOpPWjv
- Demonstrate use of container tags: div, span
- Demonstrate sizing properties and units of measure: width, height, px, %, vh, vw
- Demonstrate use of link tag: a
- Demonstrate basic transformation of text elements into a layout presentation using container tags to create visual order and heirarchy

## Exercise (645): Personal Introduction
Convert the Hello World demo into web page presenting personal content

Requirements of final output:
1. Image of a personal nature (hint: use HTML tag img)
2. Name (hint: use HTML tag h1)
3. Label text for the list that follows (hint: use HTML tag h2)
4. List of four items, such as favorite foods (hint: use HTML tag p)

Image should be sourced from an absolute URL because CodePen cannot host images.

Complete the work done on this exercise in Notepad, and post it as a pen to your new CodePen account.

## Exercise (646): Diceroll
Using today's demo of PHP as a starting point, develop a PHP app that simulates the rolling of a die.

- Write the entire script in PHP Fiddle
- Use the rand() function to generate a number
- Use the switch() statement to map the generated number to a corresponding image
- Use HTML to present the app's user interface
- The user interface should contain (1) the die roll result and (2) a button or link that initiates a new roll by refreshing the page
- Images should be sourced from absolute URLs because PHP Fiddle cannot host images
- If you wish, you can deviate from the die motif and design the web app to present some other set of images randomly

Complete the work done on this exerise in PHP Fiddle, and post it as a pen to your new CodePen account. Note this PHP app will not work in CodePen, but at least you have saved it and can host the file somewhere else later.
