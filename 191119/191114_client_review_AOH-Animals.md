- MODIFY vertical spacing of entire page to be tighter
- UPDATE cat name to "Dr. Ian Malcolm"
- UPDATE murphy cat picture
- REMOVE sambo cat element
- CHANGE bunny drawing. It's too cute, make it less Disney, remove tulips. There are no tulips in the desert.
- CHANGE jack rabbit drawing. It's too cute. Ears are more gigantic. Remove item from mouth. There is no grass in the desert.
- CHANGE grey fox drawing. Remove the thought bubble, no anthropormorphization of animals.
- CHANGE cockroach drawing. The desert cockroach is not a pest rummaging through garbage. It is a different species, one that looks for water.
- NOTE: Overall, the idea of the drawings is great. Want it to me less cute and toylike, and more about nature.
- ADD OTHER ANIMAL: Road runner
- UPDATE section title to "Other animals of Death Valley Junction"
- MODIFY other animals slideshow, add one each animal available from photo library
- UPDATE titles of other animals to singular. Example: Rabbit not bunnies.
