#### PROJECT BACKGROUND
The website anti-card.com is an e-card sharing site that features an irreverent approach to celebrating well-known social occasions while also not taking the well-known social occasions too seriously. Website visitors take delight in sharable content that can be recognized as timely/timeless, funny, shameless. Content bears an evergreen quality and is found desirable by website users on annual cycles based on social and cultural trends. The website organizes advertising opportunities based on this cyclical usage and facilitates a revenue sharing model to support and recognize artist work. The website concept thinks about two user groups. The obvious user group are the website visitors who browse, personalize, share, and open e-cards. The other important user group is the community of artists who create the art for the website’s e-card library. 

#### PROJECT SCOPE
Design work will establish the key aspects of the project’s look and feel. The primary elements of this project’s design attention are:
- Identity system
- Branding assets
- Use of color
- Use of typography
- Presentation style rules
- Layout for all screen formats including web, mobile, and email.

#### DESIGN GOALS
Design will accomplish a comprehensive visual approach to running the website. Any project participant will know how to continue development of the website in a way that maintains the visual integrity of the project brand and identity.

#### PRODUCT TARGET AUDIENCE
Website targets users who love to browse and share free internet content directly with their peers. We envision the primary user group to identify with or exhibit the following personality drivers:
- Creative
- Irreverent
- Sense of humor
- Impulsive
- Compulsive
- Busy
- Quick-thinking

#### PROJECT TIMELINE SURVEY
- PAST: In Spring 2019, a provisional design draft was produced exploring the key stages of the website user experience. Location: http://www.anti-card.com. The project has no attachments to this design draft.
- CURRENT: New design is being explored and formalized.
- FUTURE: Functionality and design will be integrated into a fully functioning website. 

#### PROJECT DELIVERABLES REQUIRED
- Design studies, presented as PDFs or HTML web pages, that depict 1-3 approaches on the presentation of brand and identity. This includes work related to the website logo; its presentation; color palette schemes for use on web pages; all typography plans addressing all key text presentations; design of visual elements such as buttons, forms, panel boxes, etc.; and considerations on how the design accommodates a responsive presentation approach.
- A style guide that articulates the use of color, type, and layout rules as it relates to the design work developed.
- Example layouts of the home page, a card browsing page, a card selection page, an email invitation, and a card viewing page. These can be prepared as either static design drafts (PSD/PDF), or as product drafts (HTML).
- Link to all source work in a format (AI, PSD, InDesign, Word, etc.) that facilitates further development and use of the design concepts.
