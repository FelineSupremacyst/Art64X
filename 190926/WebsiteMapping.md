# Website Mapping

Website mapping is an important design practice.

#### REASONS FOR MAPPING
Designers map for various reasons.

1. <b>Assess existing web product in order to better understand the design.</b> This reason supports situations such as competitive analysis and redesign research.
2. <b>Plan designs of new web product in order to more fully realize the goals of the product.</b> This reason supports situations such as idea development and proposal development.

In this introduction to website mapping, we are interested in understanding basic ways to develop both (1) <b>site maps</b> and (2) <b>page maps</b>. (These terms site map and page page tend to refer to websites. When we are designing other types of web product, we may use more general terminology, such as <b>project map</b> and <b>screen map</b>.)

## SITE MAPS

Site maps concern themselves with
1. Structure of product
2. Structure of the user experience

Site maps tend to be based on features or topics.

In the same way a grocery store organizes fresh produce in one area and frozen food in another, a web site tends to organize itself in ways that will facilitate a structured visit for users.

By developing a site map, we get to explore ways we might organize the things that will be presented on a website. This exploration will help us better understand the product, its content, its audience, and the possibilities of providing a meaningful experience.

#### QUESTIONS
- Why doesn't this website just put all elements on the same single menu?


## PAGE MAPS

Page maps define everything that exists on a page, and how those things are organized so that the page offers some kind of presentation.

Three aspects of assessment are:
1. <b>Layout elements</b> contribute to the arrangement of content on the page.
2. <b>Content elements</b> contribute to the page's value to the user.
3. <b>Design elements</b> contribute to the look and feel of the page, and to the user experience.

## APPLYING MAPPING

Understanding the layout, content, and design approach for a page allows you to develop <b>content layouts</b> and a <b>page template</b>.

### CONTENT LAYOUTS

Generally, content elements are organized into presentations. We can call these presentation objects content layouts.

Examples of content layouts:
- On the press page, the press grid (contains 9 items each consisting of a thumbnail image, a headline, and description text)
- On the Marta page, the main tribute article (consisting of a teaser text, a headline, a subheadline, an image, a pull quote, and body text)
- On opera house page, the splash slideshow (consisting of a viewing stage, images that slide into the stage, and two arrows that allow users to manually manipulate the slideshow viewer)
- On cafe page, the restaurant menu (consisting of an icon element, section label, entree title, and entree description)
- On hotel page, the brief history article
