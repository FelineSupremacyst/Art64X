# Website Mapping

Website mapping is an important design technique. Designers map the web to assess existing web product, and to plan the design of new web product.

In this introduction to website mapping, we are interested in understanding basic ways to develop both (1) site maps and (2) page maps. (These terms site map and page page tend to refer to websites. When we are designing other types of web product, we may use more general terminology, such as project map and screen map.)

## SITE MAPS

Site maps concern themselves with
1. Structure of product
2. Structure of the user experience

Site map tend to be based on features or topics. In the same way a grocery store organizes fresh produce in one area and frozen food in another, a web site tends to organize itself in ways that will facilitate a structured visit for users.

### CASE STUDY: http://www.amargosaoperahouse.org

In this case study activity, we will develop a site map for the Amargosa Opera House web site.

#### PRIMARY MAP ELEMENTS
- opera house
- hotel
- cafe

#### SECONDARY MAP ELEMENTS
- news & updates (also serves as the home page)
- marta
- press

### QUESTIONS
- Why doesn't this website just put all elements on the same single menu?


## PAGE MAPS

Page maps define everything that exists on a page, and how those things are organized.



Three aspects of assessment are:
1. Layout elements - The arrangement of the page
2. Content elements - The information on the page
3. Design elements - The way the information and arrangement are designed to be accessible and inviting

### CASE STUDY: http://www.amargosaoperahouse.org/press/

In this case study activity, we will develop a page map for the press page of the Amargosa Opera House web site.

#### LAYOUT ELEMENTS
- page header
- content header
- (content dashboard)
- content 
- content footer
- footer


#### CONTENT ELEMENTS

- header text
- story grid (thumbnail, linked title, description text

Generally, content elements are organized into presentations. We can call these presentation objects content layouts.

Examples of content layouts:
- On the press page, the press grid (contains 9 items each consisting of a thumbnail image, a headline, and description text)
- On the Marta page, the main tribute article (consisting of a teaser text, a headline, a subheadline, an image, a pull quote, and body text)
- On opera house page, the splash slideshow (consisting of a viewing stage, images that slide into the stage, and two arrows that allow users to manually manipulate the slideshow viewer)
- On cafe page, the restaurant menu (consisting of an icon element, section label, entree title, and entree description)
- On hotel page, the brief history article

#### DESIGN ELEMENTS

Design elements determine the look and feel of the page.

EXAMPLE: http://www.amargosaoperahouse.org/press

Elements noted:

- The layout is responsive (sometimes also described as mobile friendly or mobile first)
- The page background is a full bleed gradient
- The content area is a panel that floats in the page
- There is a brand slogan
- There is a brand logo
- Header text is set in script font
- Links and section labels are set in western font
- Grid item titles are set in a narrow font
- Content section titles are set in a decorative font
- Color palette includes black, browns, red, blues
- Content header and footer utilizes transparent backgrounds

## APPLYING MAPPING

Understanding the layout, content, and design approach for a page allows you to develop a template
