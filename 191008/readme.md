***Translate design elements into code assets
Now that elements are mapped in support of our design concept, those elements can be translated into code that represents the containers that our layout would accommodate to present the content according to the concept.

<section id=contentHeader>
	<div class=bigHeadline></div>
	<div class=friendlyHeadling></div>
	<div class=x-grid>
		<div class=large-4></div>
		<div class=large-4></div>
		<div class=large-4></div>
	</div>
</section>
